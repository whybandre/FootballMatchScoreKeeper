    <!-- SUGGESTION from a Review
Did you know that styles have an attribute called “parent” that let you inherit common attribute.

You could, for example, define a style called “wrap_content” that defines height and width has "wrap_content" and inherit from it,
so you do not have to repeat those two attributes again.
Check the documentation for more info:

    <!-- Base application theme. -->
    <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar">
        <!-- Customize your theme here. -->
        <item name="colorPrimary">@color/colorPrimary</item>
        <item name="colorPrimaryDark">@color/colorPrimaryDark</item>
        <item name="colorAccent">@color/colorAccent</item>
